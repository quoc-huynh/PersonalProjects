This is one of my favorite projects as I created a Social Network Graph for Marvel's Daredevil! I am planning on adding more to the graph as I want to have all Series to be graphed.
You can view the interactive graph at https://quoc-huynh.github.io/Daredevil_Graph/#


DISCLAIMER: ALL COMIC BOOK DATA USED WAS THROUGH MARVEL'S API. THE GRAPH WAS MADE USING THE GEPHI SOFTWARE AND THE WEBPAGE WAS MADE USING THE SIGMA JS EXPORTER PLUGIN. MORE INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND BELOW
