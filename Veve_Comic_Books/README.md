This Project is an on-going EDA of the Secondary Market of comic books on the Veve Platform. This project was primarily to see any certain correlations and to simply explore the dataset.The dataset is small as Veve is still in its beginning stages. As a result, I plan on creating price prediction models as the dataset evolves and combinging other datasets. The dataset was made by Redditor Butt Thompson. This project is still in development.
